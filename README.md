# Code
Here are my programs I've made. I'm a novice so don't expect anything super good. Any tips or edits are welcome

This is mostly to back up my code

If you want to use any of this you can my policy is that anyone can use my shitty code

if you wanna run any of my code do the following steps:

for python programs in windows type python into command line or the microsoft store then just download the app after just download whatever program of mine you'd like to run and run it by double clicking it.
